        <h1>Founder of Pakistan</h1>
        <p>Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah was the founder of Pakistan and one of South Asia’s most influential
            political leaders. Born on 25 December 1876 in Karachi, he was a trained lawyer who believed deeply in
            constitutionalism, justice, and the rule of law.

            Through his leadership of the All-India Muslim League, Jinnah united the Muslims of the subcontinent and
            articulated the Two-Nation Theory, which became the foundation of the Pakistan Movement. His political
            vision and determination led to the creation of Pakistan on 14 August 1947.

            After independence, he served as Pakistan’s first Governor-General and focused on building a democratic
            state based on equality, religious freedom, and national unity. Remembered as the Father of the Nation,
            Quaid-e-Azam’s principles — Unity, Faith, and Discipline — continue to guide Pakistan today.</p>
